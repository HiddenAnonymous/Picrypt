# Picrypt
A simple encryptor tool to protect strongly your files.

In order to encrypt files you must run the encrypt
tool, enter the path of your image,
example "/sdcard/Images/mypic.jpg"
Then enter the output path doing the same.
Example: "/sdcard/Documents/secret

The tool automatically saves the output file with
the ".txt" format. In order to read the encrypted
file. Once you do this you can do the same to decrypt
files with the decrypt tool.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/HiddenAnonymous/Picrypt/

```
Run the tool you want.
